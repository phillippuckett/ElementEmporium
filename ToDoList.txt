/** ng-repeat walkthrough */
/* inside the view: */
make sure that you have an ng-repeat="X in Xs"
that can utilize the X template
('class' repeats with ng-repeat, 'id' doesn't)
link the view into the controller with '{{ }}'

/* inside the view controller: */
        xService.getX().then(function (result) {
            console.log(result);
            // we're setting the result that came back from xService to $scope.Xs (in the ng-repeat)
            $scope.Xs = result;
        })
        
/* inside postman: */
copy the wanted fields in the 'X' object, 
and start editing items to post to the database
